# Sum of even indices

## Problem Description
You are given an array A of length N and Q queries given by the 2D array B of size Q*2. Each query consists of two integers B[i][0] and B[i][1].
For every query, the task is to calculate the sum of all even indices in the range A[B[i][0]â€¦B[i][1]].

Note : Use 0-based indexing

### Problem Constraints
````
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Q <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 100
0 <= B[i][0] <= B[i][1] < N
````

### Input Format
````
First argument A is an array of integers.
Second argument B is a 2D array of integers.
````

### Output Format
````
Return an array of integers.
````

### Example Input
````
Input 1:
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = [   [0,2] 
        [1,4]   ]

Input 2:
A = [2, 1, 8, 3, 9]
B = [   [0,3] 
        [2,4]   ]
````

### Example Output
````
Output 1:
[4, 8]

Output 2:
[10, 17]
````

### Example Explanation
````
Explanation 1:
The subarray for the first query is [1, 2, 3] whose sum of even indices is 4.
The subarray for the second query is [2, 3, 4, 5] whose sum of even indices is 8.

Explanation 2:
The subarray for the first query is [2, 1, 8, 3] whose sum of even indices is 10.
The subarray for the second query is [8, 3, 9] whose sum of even indices is 17.
